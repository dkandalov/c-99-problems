This project contains code for 99 problems in scala rewritten in C++ with CLion.
See http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/

Disclaimer:
This is not intended to be good code in any way, I'm just having fun.
This is definitely not idiomatic C++ and code will have tons of problems.
Otherwise, I'll be happy to fix any bugs or issues :)
